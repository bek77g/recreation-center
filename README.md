# Next.js Recreational Center Project

This Next.js project, initialized with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), serves as the foundation for a recreational center website.

## Getting Started

To begin development, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the initial result.

Start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will auto-update as you make changes.

The project utilizes [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) for automatic optimization and loading of the Inter font, a custom Google Font.
